# Ideas from 7th March brainstorm:  

Look for trends across all files to see...  
- What languages are most popular?  
- What languages are used for which types of projects?  

------  
Looking at one language and trying to see what that language is used for. Visualize it in some way.
Determine this by:  
1. Looking for READMEs.  
2. Looking at packages with Node.  
3. Looking at the code itself and trying to find themes in that.  

------  
Patterns of programmers. How often do they work? Do they work in sprints? Do they tend to upload at a particular time of day or day of the week?  
Can you find classifications of programmers? For example, the "sleeper" who pushes only once a month. The "maniac" with many pushes in a day.  

Which companies do people work for? Where in the world are they?  

------  
What are the patterns of contributors, pull requests, commits to a project? How many of each?  
How do people collaborate?  

------  
"Mark Zuckerberg connection" - How many followers/following members of Github are you from any other given member on the site. Breadth first search.  

------  
Explore our own Github profiles first. See what we can learn about ourselves.
